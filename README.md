# FYS3150_project2

## To compile the programs use the following: 

c++ -O3 [Program] -o [Desired name for program] -larmadillo -std=c++11

## Then run the program with this: 

./[Desired name for program] [Name of output text file] [Desired dimension]

### Example:
Compile with: 

c++ -O3 2b.cpp -o 2b.x -larmadillo -std=c++11

Run with:

./2b.x output 200

The output you will get in the terminal is the number of iterations it took the program and how long it took to finish the code

Now you should be able to run the code :)
